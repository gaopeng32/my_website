# Biography

Welcome to my homepage! I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://www.princeton.edu/~kulkarni/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with the highest honors. I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research for one summer, and at NEC Laboratories, America for two falls. Apart from my research, I enjoy playing basketball, table tennis, swimming and traveling.

For more information, please find my [CV](/) or [resume](pdf/info/resume.pdf).

<!--I have broad interests in software & system security, machine learning, data mining and artificial intelligence. I enjoy applying beautiful theories into real-world applications, and building practical systems.-->
