# Biography

Welcome to my homepage! I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://www.princeton.edu/~kulkarni/). I have broad research interests in machine learning, data mining, systems research, software & cloud security. I enjoy applying theories into real-world applications and building practical systems.

For more information, please find my [resume](pdf/info/resume.pdf).

<!--I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with the highest honors. I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research for one summer, and at NEC Laboratories, America for two falls. Apart from my research, I enjoy playing basketball, table tennis, swimming and traveling.
